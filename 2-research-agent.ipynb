      "Browserless\n",
      "Browserless now runs in LangChain\n",
      "Joel Griffith\n",
      "July 18, 2023\n",
      "\n",
      "Weâ€™ve begun the process of integrating Browserless with the popularÂ LangChainÂ AI library, starting with Browserlessâ€™ REST APIs. As of today, ourÂ content APIÂ is now supported as a LangChain document loader. Using Browserless to get the contents of a webpage for ingestion into LangChainâ€™s AI modules is as easy as calling from langchain.document_loaders import BrowserlessLoader\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous canonical way to get the contents of webpages in LangChain was theÂ WebBaseLoaderÂ module. This module uses theÂ requestsÂ library to make HTTP requests to the target URL. This is a perfectly valid way to get the contents of a webpage, but it has some drawbacks:\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesnâ€™t execute JavaScript, so it canâ€™t get the contents of a webpage that is dynamically generated by JavaScript.\n",
      "Itâ€™s prone to encoding issues if Python is expecting a different encoding than the webpage is using. LangChain users have reported seeing non-ASCII characters in their text when using theÂ WebBaseLoader, which is a symptom of this issue.\n",
      "Itâ€™s extremely vulnerable to anti-bot measures, since the most basic anti-bot tests can determine that the request is coming from an automated script and not a real browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the newÂ BrowserlessLoaderÂ solves all of these problems. It executes JavaScript, so it can get the contents of a webpage that is dynamically generated. It uses the Chrome browser, so it can handle any encoding that Chrome can handle. And it uses a real browser, so it can pass anti-bot tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to use it\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting the contents of a webpage using theÂ BrowserlessLoaderÂ can be accomplished in just a few lines of code:\n",
      "\n",
      "from langchain.document_loaders import BrowserlessLoader\n",
      "\n",
      "loader = BrowserlessLoader(\n",
      "    api_token=YOUR_BROWSERLESS_API_TOKEN,\n",
      "    urls=[\n",
      "        \"https://example.com/url0\",\n",
      "        \"https://example.com/url1\",\n",
      "        \"https://example.com/url2\",\n",
      "    ]\n",
      ")\n",
      "\n",
      "documents = loader.load()\n",
      "\n",
      "print(documents[0].page_content)\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply sign up for a Browserless account, get your API token, and pass it to theÂ BrowserlessLoaderÂ constructor. Pass a list of URLs to the constructor, call theÂ load()Â method, and youâ€™ll get back a list ofÂ DocumentÂ objects, each of which has aÂ page_contentÂ attribute that contains the text of the webpage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential use cases\n",
      "\n",
      "Extracting the contents of webpages can be a useful step in many different AI workflows. For example, you could use theÂ BrowserlessLoaderÂ to get the contents of a webpage, and then use a long-context LLM like GPT-4 or Claude to extract particular fields from the text, even if they appear in different places across multiple webpages. You could get the contents of a blog post and then summarize it using LangChainâ€™s LLM wrappers. You could keep tabs on an online forum by getting the contents of the forumâ€™s pages and then using a classifier to identify posts that are relevant to you. LangChain has a thriving open-source community, check out theÂ LangChain GitHubÂ for more ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatâ€™s next\n",
      "\n",
      "In the short term: the LangChain team is currently working on modifying theirÂ RecursiveWebLoaderÂ wrapper class to support theÂ BrowserlessLoaderÂ as a document loader. This will allow you to get the contents of a webpage and all of its child pages, recursively, using theÂ BrowserlessLoader, allowing for a higher quality guarantees on the contents of the pages and a more robust way to handle anti-bot measures. This is more akin to how larger companies crawl the web, so you can think of it as a more robust web-crawler.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the long term, weâ€™re looking into more seamless integrations between Browserless and LangChain, including controlling a stateful browser session from within LangChain. This opens the possibility of using LangChain to automate web tasks that require a browser, like filling out forms or interacting with a websiteâ€™s UI. Stay tuned for more updates!\n",
